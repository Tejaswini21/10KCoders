            <summary>Types Of Variables</summary>
            <br/>
           varibales are used for storing the data . We are hvaing three types of varibales They are:
            <ul>
                <li>Let</li>
                <li>Const</li>
                <li>Var</li>
                <br/>
            <p>
            Var is used to declare the variables and it is the older version
            </p>
            
                </ul>
        </details>
       <h2>Operators in JS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Arithmetic Operators</li>
            <li>Logical Operators</li>
            <li>Assignment Operators</li>
            <li>Comparison Operatos</li>
            
        </ul>
        <h1> Arithmetic Operators</h1>
        <p> Here in arithmetic operators we can perform basic mathematical operations </p>
        <br/>
        <h1>Assignment Operatos</h1>
        <p>Assignment operators include mathematical operations and we can represent  += this is used for additon similarly we can perfrom operations like -=, *=, /=, %=  ** this two stars are used for represent power</p>
        <br/>
        <h2>Comparison Operators</h2>
        <p> Comparison Operators used to compare both variables <ol>
            <li><=</li>
            <LI>==</LI>
            <LI>>=</LI>
            <li>== it compares the value when we give strict equal to which is === it compares the value and type</li>
            

        </ol></p>
<h3>Logical Operatos </h3>
<p> Logical operators used to perform logical operations<ol>
   <li>And is used to perform operations two values or two strings if any one value is false then output is false and it is represented using &&</li> 
   <li>Or is used to perform operarions on two values or two strings if any one is true then output is true and is represented using ||</li>
   <li> NOT is used when any value is True it performs reverse operions so the output will be false</li>
</ol></p>
<br/>
<hr/>
<h1> We are having typeof function</h1>
<p>Typeof is used to represent the type of a value or variable it is int,string or float</p>
