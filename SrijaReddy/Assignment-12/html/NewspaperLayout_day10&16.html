                 <img class="image" src="../Images/modi.webp" alt="modi" height="400px" width="500px"/>
                 <p class="para">Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday warned people that voting for the JDS was like voting for the Congress. "The JDS has declared it are just expecting 15-20 seats and will become kingmaker," Modi said, calling the regional party the 'B-team' of the Congress and a "private limited party of a family".

                    The PM lashed out at the two parties at the election rallies in Kolar, Ramanagar and Hassan districts, where the BJP is struggling to expand its footprint. The 2018 assembly poll data show the Congress dominates Kolar district while the JDS is strong in Ramanagar, Mandya and Hassan districts.

                    The old Mysuru region, spread across nine districts excluding Bengaluru rural and urban districts, accounts for about a fourth of Karnataka's 224-member Assembly.</p>
