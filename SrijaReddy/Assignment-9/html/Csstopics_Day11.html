       <h3>CSS Types</h3>

       <h5>Inline CSS</h5>
       <p>Inline CSS is used to style a specific HTML element. Add a style attribute to each HTML tag without using the selectors. Managing a website may difficult if we use only inline CSS. </p>
       <h5>Internal CSS</h5>
       <p>The Internal CSS has &lt style &gt tag in the &lt head &gt section of the HTML document. This CSS style is an effective way to style single pages</p>
       <h5>External CSS</h5>
