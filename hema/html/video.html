        <h2>Lightning is a giant spark of electricity in the atmosphere between clouds, the air, or the ground.<br/>
         In the early stages of development, air acts as an insulator between the positive and negative charges in the cloud and between the cloud and the ground.<br/>
          When the opposite charges build up enough, this insulating capacity of the air breaks down and there is a rapid discharge of electricity that we know as lightning.<br/>
           The flash of lightning temporarily equalizes the charged regions in the atmosphere until the opposite charges build up again.<br/>

        Lightning can occur between opposite charges within the thunderstorm cloud (intra-cloud lightning) or between opposite charges in the cloud and on the ground (cloud-to-ground lightning).</h2> </div>
